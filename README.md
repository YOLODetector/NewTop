To address the lack of specialized open-source datasets in the field of paper cup defect detection, this study has independently constructed the NEWTOP paper cup defect detection dataset. The dataset was collected using an INOVANCE V21-020GM-060 black-and-white industrial area array camera in various production environments and experimental setups, utilizing an IL-RI10090W ring light source, with a shooting resolution of 1440Ã—1080 pixels. To enhance the representativeness of the dataset and the generalization ability of the model, it includes typical defect types encountered during the paper cup forming process. The dataset contains a total of 1,892 images, categorized into five defect types: wrinkles, spots, stains, breakages, and empty cups, as shown in Figure 11. The image quality and scene consistency were strictly controlled during the data collection process. The collection equipment is an industrial-grade black-and-white camera capable of clearly capturing subtle defects on the surface of the paper cups. The shooting environments include various production lines and experimental setups to simulate the complex scenarios encountered in actual industrial production, thereby enhancing the robustness of the datase
